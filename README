A brainfuck interpreter for the c64.
All instructions are supported.
Loops cannot be nested more than 255 times.

To enter programming mode POKE 259, 00 then run the program.
In this mode simply enter each instruction (E to Exit).
To enter execute mode POKE 259, 01. The program will now run.
To enter debug print mode POKE 259, 64. The program will now be printed to the screen.
To change the starting location of the code area poke 2061 and 2062 with a new location.
To change the data location poke 2063 and 2064.

Repl flag values:
; repl flag sets up the program mode
; possible values:
;   00 -> code input mode
;   7th bit = 1 -> output current instruction during execution
;   6th bit = 1 -> ouput program
;
;
;   the following file commands requires the user to set up file_name, flogical, fsecondary and fdevice
;   5th bit = 1 -> set file as input
;   4th bit = 1 -> set file as output
;   3rd bit = 1 -> load prg from file to bfcode_ptr
;   2nd bit = 1 -> save bfcode_ptr contents to file until \0
;
;   1st bit -> execute code
